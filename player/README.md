**Scribe player**

`index.html` file has meta tags for open graph and twitter card.

They point to the player in the player.html

This makes twitter and mastodon to display the audio player in an iframe and makes it an embedded player that can be played directly on those platforms when `https://labs.cruncher.ch/scribe/player` URL is posted on one of these platforms.
